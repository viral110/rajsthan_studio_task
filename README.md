## short explanation of what I built

1. First Page display photos and video and each photos fetch from api that you give me.

2. Second Page display touch the heart button and its give some reaction that we touch the heart button this photos automatically push on add to favourite page.

3. Third page display your wishlist that you like.

4. Fourth page is you choose one photo which you like and know som details about your like photos so this function work likely you want means this page shows details of photo
